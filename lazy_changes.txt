Release Name: 0.7.0 10/18/2000

lazy.py provides support for lazy expressions, lazy tuples
(functional programming languages call these lazy lists, but since lists are
mutable in Python, tuples are closer in meaning), and lazy equivalents
for map, filter, reduce, and zip.


Changes:

06/01/01 - Version 0.8:

    Thanks to Steven Cleary for bug reports and suggestions.
    
    Changed class hierarchy as follows:
        
                 LazyExpr
                /
        Lazy---|                 LazyTuple
                \               /
                 LazySequence --
                                \
                                 LazySlice

    Several bugs were fixed, and the difference between (possibly)
    infinite sequences and sequences which are known to terminate, but
    at an unknown length is now explicit. As a result of changing the
    class hierarchy, LazyTuple now takes far fewer constructor arguments.

    Change to PyUnit for testing.    
        
10/18/2000 - Version 0.7:
    Lazy has become its own module now, since functional was growing
    somewhat large.
