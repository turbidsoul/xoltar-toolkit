Release Name: 1.0.1

Notes:
This module uses the threading and Queue modules to create a pool of reusable
threads.

After creating an instance of ThreadPool, one queues functions to be
excecuted. The pool dispatches the functions to the waiting threads, which
call them.

When queueing a function on the pool with *pool*.put(), an instance
of ReturnValue is returned. ReturnValue is a subclass of functional.Lazy, and
can be used in any context that a regular lazy expression can. When evaluating
a ReturnValue, the evaluating thread will block until the other thread has
completed its work and loaded the return value of the function into the
ReturnValue instance.

VLocks are an alternative to RLocks which include a visible queue threads waiting
for the lock.

lock, unlock, getLockFor, and deleteLockFor work with a module-level
dictionary of objects to locks, and can be more convenient than working with
lock objects directly.

Locked and Async are callable wrappers around a function. Async calls return
immediately after queueing their function on a thread pool, while Locked calls
first acquire the lock they were passed on creation, call their function, and
release the lock.

Changes:
11/4/2000:
    Thread pools can be set to use daemon threads or not by passing a one or
    zero for the named parameter 'daemon' when constructing one. By default,
    thread pools now use daemon threads.

    By passing an optional 'associated' argument to ThreadPool.put, the thread
    which actually runs that job will have that data associated with it while
    it's doing that job. Calling *thread*.getAssociatedData() will return it.
    This could be useful for associating some sort of security information with
    the task, for instance.
